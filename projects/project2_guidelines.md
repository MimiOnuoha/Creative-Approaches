# Project 2 

## Overview

**Topic**: The Internet

The internet has become an inherently interactive network that is crucial to how many of us conduct our lives today. For your second project, you need to work in teams to create a piece of work about the internet. 

Your assignment is to choose any aspect of the internet (physical, cultural, historical, political, economic, cellular, etc) that is hidden or that you find surprising and find a way to communicate some aspect of it. It may help you to define an intended audience for yourself; if you can't come up with one, imagine that your audience is composed of your Olin classmates. It may also help you to come up with a piece that answers a question. Starting from a question can help you identify the things that you find interesting to explore, or give you a direction for consideration. 

## Presentations

Your presentations should be about 7 minutes long.  For your presentation, walk us through your project from start to finish. What was your idea? Why did you want to do it? How did you do it? What did you end up with as a final piece? What did you learn? Feel free to use slides if you like. 

You will need to have a **documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer) that is due the same week as your project.
