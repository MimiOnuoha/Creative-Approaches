# Project 2 

## Overview

**Topic**: The Internet
**Medium:** Interactive Art 

The internet has become an inherently interactive network that is crucial to how many of us conduct our lives today. For your second project, you need to create an interactive artwork about the internet. 

Working in teams, your assignment is to choose an aspect of the internet that is hidden or that you find surprising and find a way to communicate it. Imagine that your audience is composed of your Olin classmates. Keep in mind that interactivity can look like a number of things: a workshop, a website, a mobile app, a performance. The only requirement is that your audience cannot passively sit and listen; they must participate in some meaningful way. 

## Presentations

Your presentations should be about 7 minutes long.  For your presentation, walk us through your project from start to finish. What was your idea? Why did you want to do it? How did you do it? What did you end up with as a final piece? What did you learn? Feel free to use slides if you like. 

You will need to have a **documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer) that is due the same week as your project.
