# Project 3

## Overview

**Topic**: Automation, AI, Algorithms 
**Medium:** Object 

Your final project is different than the previous two. Unlike the others, you will have much more time to work on this, so I will be paying close attention to your conceptual idea as well as your final implementation. You also will present twice: your first presentation will be about concept and prototypes, whereas your second one will be your final presentation. This means that you will have ample time to get feedback, responses, and seek guidance from your fellow classmates and me. 

Think about the conversations we have had about data collection, the internet, automation, and social algorithms. What do you think about all of this? What strikes you as good, or unfair, or unacknowledged, or worth diving into? What questions have you seen, and what answers (or explorations) do you have? Create an object that elucidates some aspect of your point of view. Make an argument, establish a position, decide what your opinion is, and communicate something to us. Your object can be interactive, tied to a larger system or process, or it can be stand-alone. You can work in groups of up to four or you can elect to create your project individually. 

Eventually, this object will be on display to the rest of campus, so keep this in mind. Be ambitious, be thoughtful, be thorough. 

## Presentations

For your final presentations the last week of class, we will have guest critiques. Their feedback will be considered in your evaluation for the project. 

Your presentations should be about 10 minutes long.  For your presentation, walk us through your project from start to finish. What was your idea? Why did you want to do it? How did you do it? What did you end up with as a final piece? What did you learn? Feel free to use slides if you like. 

You will need to have a **documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer) that is due the same week as your project.
