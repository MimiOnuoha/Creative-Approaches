# Project 1 

## Overview

**Topic**: Data, collection, archives 
**Medium:** Data visualization 

We've spent the last couple of weeks thinking about art, tech, and data collection. For your first assignment, you are tasked with creating a representation or visualization in response to a dataset. 

[*This document will be updated with a link to the exact dataset on 9/18.*  ]

You should make an analog visualization or representation based off of this dataset.  Note that you may use software to make sense of the dataset, provided that your final project is analog. Feel free to interpret the words "visualization" and "representation" in whichever way you want. For instance, you could create a straightforward manifestation of the data you are seeing, or you can choose to focus on or be inspired by any aspect of the dataset. 

You will work with one other person. Post an entry on your blog that documents what you did, why you did it, and what it looks like. 

## Presentations

Your presentations should be about 7 minutes long.  For your presentation, walk us through your project from start to finish. What was your idea? Why did you want to do it? How did you do it? What did you end up with as a final piece? What did you learn? Feel free to use slides if you like. 

You will need to have a **documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer) that will be due the same week as your project.
