# Project 1 

## Overview

**Topic: Data**
**Due date: October 3**

We've spent the last couple of weeks thinking about data collection and what it means to make artworks and creative interventions. For your first project assignment, you are tasked with creating a project that engages with both of these. 

For your week 2 homework assignment, you wrote a review of a new media art piece. For this assignment, you need to create your own piece that emulates the style of whatever project or piece you wrote about. You should change the *subject* of your own piece, but do it in the same *style* as the original work. 

(For instance: if you chose to write about [*Prison Map*,](http://prisonmap.com/) then you could create your own website that holds a grid of all the satellite images of schools in Massachusetts, as an example). 

You have the option to work with one other person, if you like. In this case, you have the option of choosing between the pieces that either of you wrote about for the week 2 assignment. Post an entry on your blog that documents what you did, why you did it, and what it looks like. 

## Presentations

Your presentations should be about 7 minutes long.  For your presentation, walk us through your project from start to finish. What was the project that you were responding to, and how did you think about how to approach doing this?  What did you end up with as a final piece? In which ways is your piece different from the original, and which aspects were you focused on changing or replicating? You should use slides to present your work. 

You will need to have a **documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer) on your blog that accompanies the project. Upload it using the homework link.
