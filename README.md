## Course Description

We live in a world where we have more data, computational power, and access to digital connectivity than ever before. But how do we make sense of the promise inherent in this reality while also coming to terms with the challenges that it presents? How do we situate the technologies that we have come to take for granted? And more importantly, how do we create active and creative responses that interrogate and hint at the potential for different futures?  

This course examines emergent technological fields, spanning topics like data collection/representation, artificial intelligence, social algorithms, surveillance, and digital mapping and asks how the technologies inherent to each can be leveraged for response, creation, and critique.

While this course is primarily conceptual and theory-based, the content covered will be technical in nature and students will be tasked with making three creative responses to the content in the tradition of the new media/digital art and design worlds. 

## Goals

In this class, students will:

- Consider technology from a sociotechnical and politcal gaze. This entails understanding what technology offers, does, and situating it within its context, history, and variable perspectives
- Investigate different types of and fields for creative response, creation, and exploration, situated within but not limited to, the arts. 
- Create works of art that engage with and further conversation about emerging technology. 

## Format

Excluding a two-week introduction in the beginning of the semester, the class is split into three sections. Each section will cover a different theme tied to some topic concerning emerging technology, and will highlight a different art medium that students will use to respond to that theme. Students will work individually, in pairs, and in groups over the course of the semester. 

For some weeks, there will be additional links, readings or resources provided. It is not necessary for you to look at these, though they are interesting and provide useful connections and counterpoints to the material that we discuss in class.

I can be reached via email at all times, but I am very slow to respond to emails sent over the weekend. If you are in need of a prompt response, please email during the week. I reserve 24 hours to respond, but typically will reply much sooner. 

## Expectations and Requirements

- Class attendance and punctuality
- Participation during class discussions and presentations
- Weekly readings 
- Three section projects + accompanying blogposts

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.  

All students are allowed a maximum of two absences. It is worth stressing that because the class covers so much new material, it is very much to your advantage to not miss any classes, if possible. 

## Evaluation

Final evaluation will be based on the completion of all assignments, blogposts, class participation, quality of work, and attendance. The breakdown is below:

| Assignment                       | Percentage of Grade |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Homework and Class Participation | 25%                 |
| Classmate Project Evaluations    | 5%                  |
| Project 1                        | 15%                 |
| Project 2                        | 25%                 |
| Final Project                    | 30%                 |
|                                  |                     |

Homework is graded on completion: to get the full marks, you simply need to complete the assignment. If there is an aspect that needs to be submitted, you should submit at least **two hours** before the start of class using the homework form. 

We will discuss in class the rubrics for grading the projects.

## Syllabus

**WEEK ONE (September 5):** Introductions, part 1   
*This class will introduce us to one another and set up the topics of the semester, conveying both examples of emerging technology and the concept of art as a space for creative response.*   

HOMEWORK: 

- Complete [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/kRfiAUwTg5U2WXgN2) about your interests, experience in different domains, work style, etc.  (Link again: https://goo.gl/forms/kRfiAUwTg5U2WXgN2)
- Set up a blog or website set up for this class. For more control under the hood, I recommend creating a site using [Github Pages](https://medium.com/spemer/free-github-blog-and-hosting-with-jekyll-c24c408d158f) (for example, [this one](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) is very straightforward). But you can also use Tumblr, Canvas, Wordpress, or any other platform.
- Read [Bad Writer](https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/bad-writer/) by Michael Mohammed Ahmad and post a 250-300 word response on your thoughts about the piece on your blog. Submit it using the homework form. 
- Extra reading [optional]
  - Blaine Pascal, Pensée [#252](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm)
  - bell hooks, [*Teaching Critical Thinking*](http://cdn0.inwithforward.com/images/bell-hooks-critical-thinking.pdf?mtime=20140729104110) 



**WEEK TWO (September 12):** Introductions, part 2  
*We will examine the field of media art, and consider what it means to evaluate works of art.*

HOMEWORK: 

- Read: 
  - [The Point of Collection](https://points.datasociety.net/the-point-of-collection-8ee44ad7c2fa)
  - [Five Things We Need To Know About Technological Change](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/materials/postman.pdf)

- Last week you read "[Bad Writer](https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/bad-writer/)", by Michael Mohammad Ahmad. In the piece, Ahmad talks about the need for those making creative pieces to have communities who can engage critically with their work.  **Your homework assignment is to evaluate one of the pieces that we looked at in class and respond by writing a 300-400 word review/critique* of it.**  What is the piece trying to do or say? What about the piece appeals to you? What works about it? What doesn't work? What could make it stronger, and what is adding to or taking away from its impact? Consider aspects like content, form, style, context, etc. Be thorough and thoughtful. Post the response on your blog or website and send it using the homework form. 

  - *When I say "critique", I don't mean that you should be mean or aggressive (no need to emulate Ahmad's tone in Bad Writer, unless you have a compelling reason for it). It is totally fine to take the position that the work you are reviewing is a masterpiece, but you do need to explain to us why you think this. 
  - The link to the list of projects you saw is [here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/CAET2018). You can also find a copy in the week2 folder. 

- Extra reading [optional]

  - [Art Against Information](http://eleven.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-067-art-against-information-case-studies-in-data-practice/) by Mitchell Whitelaw

  - Sorting Things Out* introduction (see readings folder)

**WEEK THREE (September 19):**  Collections and Archives, part 1  
*We'll finish up our conversation on how to evaluate art and begin a conversation around data collection, categorization, and considering datasets as a form of archive.*

HOMEWORK:

- Read: 
  - "Representation and the Necessity of Interpretation" by Laura Kurgan (excerpt from *Close Up At A Distance*, see reading folder)
  - *Objectivity* by Lorraine Daston, Peter Galison (see reading folder, the selections are a couple of pages from the book. Ignore the section on page 19 titled "Collective Empiricism")
- This week in class we began our conversation on what data is and how we should consider it. This week's homework assignment continues that discussion by focusing on maps and geographic data in particular. Do the reading, think about what we discuss, think about what you were able to glean from the dataset we briefly looked at in class, and respond on your blog to all of the following questions (submit using the homework form):
  - If all data is interpreted, as Kurgan (and some of you) say, what are datasets really tell us? How do we know when and how we can trust a dataset, and is there a standard rule for this? 
  - What are the different types of truth that a dataset can have? Can data reflect a number of different realities at once? 
- Start thinking about and working on your first project! See the link in the projects folder for more information. 
- Next week in class we will be doing an outdoor activity, dress appropriately! 

**WEEK FOUR (September 26):**  Collections and Archives, part 2  
*How do we use datasets without even realizing it? Considering maps as a form of data representation and visualization that highlight some of the most salient points about collection.* 

HOMEWORK:

 - Work on your projects! See the description in the projects folder. Remember that you need three things:
    - The deliverable, aka your actual project
    - Documentation post submitted before class with the homework link 
    -  7 minute presentation 
       - Head's up: we'll be rigid about sticking to the time limit. You don't have to use slides for this presentation, but they may be useful for you. Make sure to tell us the name of the project you're responding to, but you don't have to give anything more than a one-line description of it. 

Feel free to email if you have any questions, I'll also be around on Thursday from 10-2 and Tuesday pretty much all day. 

**WEEK FIVE (October 3):**  Project 1 Presentations

**WEEK SIX (October 10):**  The Internet, part 1  
*For the purposes of this class, everything begins with the Internet. Where did it come from, how does it work, and what does it mean for such a widely-used medium to have so much of its inner workings concealed?*

**WEEK SEVEN (October 17):**  The Internet, part 2   
*What does it mean for such a widely-used medium to have much of its inner workings concealed?*
