- Set up a blog or website set up for this class. For more control under the hood, I recommend creating a site using [Github Pages](https://medium.com/spemer/free-github-blog-and-hosting-with-jekyll-c24c408d158f) (for example, [this one](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) is very straightforward). But you can also use Tumblr, Canvas, Wordpress, or any other platform.
